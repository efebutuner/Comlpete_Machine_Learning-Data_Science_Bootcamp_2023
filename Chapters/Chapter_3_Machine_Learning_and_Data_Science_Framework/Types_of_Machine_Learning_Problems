Main Types of Machine Learning:
    -> Supervised Learning
    -> Unsupervised Learning
    -> Transfer Learning
    -> Reinforcement Learning
    
Supervised Learning: Data and Labels, Machine learning algorithm tries to find label by using data. Regression and Classification are some popular type of supervised learning. If 2 options only --> Binary Classification, Multiple options --> Multi-Class Classification. Regression problem may be house price prediction.

Unsupervised Learning: Only Data, we do not have Labels in Unsupervised Learning. We try to plot the data, cluster it in groups and than label those data groups for classification and prediction.

Transfer Learning: You can fine tune already existing machine learning model to predict or figure out an image classification or data.

Reinforcement Learning: Rewarding a machine learning model if it predicts well and punishing for wrong implementations.

While choosing our learning model we should find out whether we have inputs and outputs or relation between them to make a correct choice of learning model.
