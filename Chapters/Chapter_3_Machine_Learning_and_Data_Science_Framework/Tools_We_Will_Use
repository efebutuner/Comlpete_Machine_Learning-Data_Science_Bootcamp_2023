We will be using Anaconda on our computer.
We will download jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy scikitlearn, matplotlib, pytorch, tensorflow
We basically will use jupyter notebooks to program and create our Machine Learning projects
For Data Analysis(First 4 parts of 6 Step Process) => Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy
For Machine Learing(5th Step of & Step Process) => TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikitlearn, Catboost, dmlc XGBoost
