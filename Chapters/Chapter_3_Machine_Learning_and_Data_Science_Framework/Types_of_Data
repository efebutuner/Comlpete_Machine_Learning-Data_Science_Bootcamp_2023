Data Kinds:
--> Structured Data: Excel Files like customer or patient records. We can say that table like data can be called Structured Data.
--> Unstructured Data: Images, Natural Language, Transcribed phone calls. 
-> Static Data: Data that is seperated with for example commas. Values do nat change over time. (The More Data The Better)
-> Streaming Data: Data that is changed over time.

Data Science Workflow:
Static Data => Jupyter, Spyder, etc. => Pandas => Data Analysis => Matplotlib => Machine Learning Model => Prediction
