First we open the terminal:
user_name$ cd desktop -> changes the directory to desktop.
desktop user_name$ mkdir sample_project -> makes a directory or folder named sample_project
desktop user_name$ ls  -> lists all the folders in that desktop
desktop user_name$ cd sample_project -> changes the directory to sample_project
sample_project user_name$ ls -> lists the folders inside sample_project
sample_project user_name$ conda create --prefix ./env pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn --> creates an environment inside sample_project that has the packages specified

To activate the environment:
$ conda activate /Users/user_name/Desktop/sample_project/env

To deactivate:
$ conda deactivate

$ conda env list --> lists the conda environments

To download Jupyter Notebook to the environment:
$ conda install jupyter

To open Jupyter Notebook from Terminal:
$ jupyter notebook

Writing code to the Jupyter Notebook:
create a python 3 file and start writing codes to the blocks in Jupyter Notebook

Closing Jupyter Notebook:
We hit ctrl+s to save the Jupyter Notebook while we are in terminal and we write $ conda deactivate to close the environment

After closing our environment, to reconnect to it we must write:
sample_project user_name$ conda activate /Users/User_Name/Desktop/sample_project/env (the path of our environment)
and after that to reconnect to the Jupyter Notebook:
sample_project user_name$ jupyter notebook

To Clear the terminal:
clear (and hit enter)
