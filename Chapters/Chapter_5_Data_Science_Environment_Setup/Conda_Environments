Conda makes us able to create an Environment for our project.
Environment ==> Packages and Modules all together that are used in a Project.
When Setting up a new Project:
    -> Create a new Folder in Desktop
    -> Get all the files and environments inside that folder for ease of use. (Data Sets, Notebooks, Environments...)
