Machine learning is using an algorithm to make a computer learn data and than use that algorithm to make machine predict data from similar data.
Input is a ingreedient and we have set of instructions. In machine learning those instructions are the outputs of data related with input.
In machine learning, we usually have inputs and ideal outputs for predictions and model training.
Data Analysis: Looking at data which will conclude by making graphs or gaining incomes from the data.
Data Science: Running experiments on data for gaining actionable insights from it. For ex: trying to make a ML project to predict data.
