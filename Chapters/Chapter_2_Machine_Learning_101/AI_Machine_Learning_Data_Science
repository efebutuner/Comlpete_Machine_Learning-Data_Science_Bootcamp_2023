Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks
Each AI is good on something only.
Narrow AI means that that AI is developed for only 1 task.
General AI means the AI that artificial intelligence that can perform more than 1 task(we are not close to it yet)
Machine Learning is the science to get computers act without being explicitly programmed.
Deep Learning is only one of the techiques of implementing Machine Learning.
Data Science is another concept but its highly related with Machine Learning so we can say that it overlaps ML.
