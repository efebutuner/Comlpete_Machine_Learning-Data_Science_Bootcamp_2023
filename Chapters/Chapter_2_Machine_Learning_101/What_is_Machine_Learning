What is Machine Learning?
-> Programming consists mainly of making a computer calculate the shortest way and solution for some problem. We give some information and set some functions in computers for them to compute us math which will be much faster rather than us computing it.
-> How do we ask a computer what a cat is?
-> Machine Learning aims to make machines more and more likely to humans. As Machines become clever, they will help us solve our problems easier and faster.
